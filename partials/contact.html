<h3>Another great idea</h3>
<p>The app can enable game play through social network connection.
A private or public game can be initiated by any member. The centralised cloud app then
pulls all song info from the players devices, creates the grid and distributes back to 
all players game views. When all players are ready (a time limit will be imposed), denoted
by a small green light/music/app icon beside their username,
the game initialiser can then start the auto generated playlist.</p>

<p>There is several important factors which need to be decided. These include the following:
	<ul>
		<li>How many simultaneous players?</li>
		<li>How to match players of similar music tastes?</li>
		<li>How long should a game be?</li>
	</ul>
