Re: partials/firebase.html
To protect my personal Firebase, the database used in this project is currently not writable. 
NOTE: Firebase Read/Wrtie setttings in the Security & Rules tab of your Firebase dashboard. The ability to write to a Firebase database can be controlled by changing the rules setting of ".write" to true/false.

To Run

Go to root of project
Run node server
